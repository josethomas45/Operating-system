# Operating System

## Overview

This repository contains **my work and exercises on Operating Systems** concepts. It provides an in-depth look at how operating systems function, from process management to memory handling and file systems. The materials in this repository include both theoretical explanations and practical examples.

### Key Topics:
- **Process Management**: Includes concepts like process scheduling, inter-process communication (IPC), and process synchronization.
- **Memory Management**: Covers topics such as virtual memory, paging, segmentation, and memory allocation.
- **File Systems**: Includes examples of file system structures and management techniques.
- **Concurrency and Deadlocks**: Demonstrates handling concurrency and resolving deadlocks using different algorithms.

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/josethomas45/Operating-system.git
   ```

2. **Compile the C programs**:
   The examples in this repository are written in C. To compile a program, navigate to the respective folder and use the GCC compiler:
   ```bash
   gcc -o output_program program_name.c
   ```

3. **Run the compiled program**:
   Once compiled, run the program using:
   ```bash
   ./output_program
   ```

## Key Topics Covered

1. **Process Management**:
   - Implementation of CPU scheduling algorithms like First-Come-First-Serve (FCFS), Shortest Job First (SJF), and Round Robin.
   - Inter-process communication (IPC) mechanisms like pipes and message queues.
   - Process synchronization using semaphores, mutexes, and monitors.

2. **Memory Management**:
   - Virtual memory concepts including paging and segmentation.
   - Different memory allocation strategies like dynamic allocation using `malloc()` and `free()`.

3. **File Systems**:
   - Simulation of file allocation methods (contiguous, linked, and indexed).
   - Implementation of various directory structures (single-level, two-level, and tree-structured directories).

4. **Concurrency and Deadlocks**:
   - Solutions to deadlock problems, including deadlock avoidance with the Banker's algorithm and detection techniques.
   - Handling concurrency using locks, semaphores, and monitors.

## Requirements

- **GCC Compiler**: Required to compile the C programs.
- **Linux/Unix Environment**: Recommended for running most of the programs, as they are designed for Unix-like operating systems.
- **Basic C knowledge**: Understanding of C programming is required to modify and run the programs.
